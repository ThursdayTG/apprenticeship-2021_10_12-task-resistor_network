The second problem we were tasked to solve, though this time by a substitute teacher, as our main teacher was written sick, lol

It was around this time when I learnt how to utilise header files. I learnt this in my free time MUCH sooner than the rest of my class, and, even though my usage of it is still rather limited as of 2021, I am quite glad to already be able to utilise header files.

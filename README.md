Another problem we were tasked to solve - this time actually not by our main teacher, but by a substitute teacher instead. While alpha and bravo - again - are two separate versions, it was around this time when I learnt how to utilise header files. I learnt this in my free time MUCH sooner than the rest of my class, and, even though my usage of it is rather limited so far, I am quite glad to already be able to utilise header files.

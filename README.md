This was the third problem that we were tasked to solve, though this time by a substitute teacher, as our main teacher was written sick.

We did not learn about loops in class until quite a bit later. Likewise, we also have not learnt about using header files at this time. But since our main teacher wasn't there to complain, I didn't have much reason to care.

This project has been uploaded primarily for archiving purposes.
